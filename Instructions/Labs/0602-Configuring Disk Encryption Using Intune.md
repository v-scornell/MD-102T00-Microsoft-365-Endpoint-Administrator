# Practice Lab: Configuring Disk Encryption Using Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you will configure BitLocker disk encryption using Intune.

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0203-Manage Device Enrollment into Intune

- 0204-Enrolling devices into Intune

- 0301-Creating and Deploying Configuration Profiles

  Note: You will also need a mobile phone that can receive text messages used to secure Windows Hello sign in authentication to Azure AD.

### Scenario

It's been determined that all the information on SEA-WS1 should be encrypted. You've been asked to configure full disk encryption on SEA-WS1 and require additional PIN authentication at startup.

### Task 1: Configure device configuration policy in Intune

1. Sign in to **SEA-SVR1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd** and close **Server Manager**.

2. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

3. In Microsoft Edge, type **https://intune.microsoft.com** in the  address bar, and then press **Enter**. 

4. Sign in as as **`admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`** with the default tenant password.

5. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, select **Endpoint security** from the navigation bar.

6. On the **Endpoint security| Overview** page, select **Disk encryption**.

7. On the **Endpoint security| Disk encryption** blade, in the details pane, select **Create Policy**.

8. In the **Create a profile** page, select the following options, and then select **Create**:

    -   Platform: **Windows 10 and later**
    -   Profile: **BitLocker**

11. On the **Configurations settings** page, expand **BitLocker - OS Drive Settings** and then configure the following options:
     - BitLocker system drive policy: **Configure**
     - Startup authentication required: **Yes**
     - Compatible TPM startup: **Allowed**
     - Compatible TPM startup PIN: **Allowed**
     - System drive recovery: **Configure**
     - Recovery key file creation: **Allowed**
     - Require device to back up recovery information to Azure: **Yes**
     - Recovery password creation: **Required**
     - Hide recovery options during BitLocker setup: **Yes**
     - Enable BitLocker after recovery information to store: **Yes**
     - Minimum PIN length: **4**

12. On the **Configurations settings** page, select **Next**.

13. On the **Scope tags** page, select **Next**.

14. On the **Assignments** tab, under **Included groups** select **Add groups**. 

15. Select **Contoso Developer devices**, choose **Select**, and then select **Next**.

16. On the **Review + create** page, select **Create**.

17. Close all open windows on **SEA-SVR1**.

### Task 2: Verify and enable BitLocker settings

1. On **SEA-WS1**, sign in as **Aaron Nicholls** with the PIN **102938**.
    
2. On the taskbar, select **Start** and then select the **Settings** app.

3. In the **Settings** app, select **Accounts** and then select **Access work or school**.

4. In the **Access work or school** section, select the **Connected to Contoso's Azure AD** link and then select **Info**. Select **Sync**.

5. Select the **Encryption needed** notification.

   _Note: It may take some time until the notification shows up._

6. On the **Are you ready to start encryption?** dialog, select the checkbox next to **I don't have any other disk encryption software installed, encrypt all my disks**, and select **Yes**.

7. On the **Choose how to unlock your drive at startup?** page, select **Enter a PIN**

8. On the **Enter a PIN** page, in the **PIN** and **Reenter PIN** boxes, enter **1234**, and then select **Set PIN**.

9. On the **Choose how much of your drive to encrypt** page, select **Encrypt used disk space only** and select **Next**.
   
11. On the **Choose which encryption mode to use** page, ensure that **New encryption mode (best for fixed drives on this device)** is selected, and then select **Next**.
    
12. On the **Are you ready to encrypt this drive** page, select **Continue**. Wait for the encryption to complete.

13. At the **Encryption of C: is complete** message, select **Close**, and then restart **SEA-WS1**.

14. When **SEA-WS1** restarts, type **1234** and press **Enter** to unlock the drive.

### Task 3: Verify BitLocker protection

1. Sign in to **SEA-WS1** as **Aaron Nicholls** with the PIN **102938**.

2. On the taskbar, select **File Explorer** and then select **This PC**.

3. In the navigation pane, right-click **Local Disk (C:)**, select **Show more options**, and then select **Manage BitLocker**.

4. In the **BitLocker Drive Encryption** window, ensure that you see **C: BitLocker on** status. This means that drive is encrypted. 

5. Close all open windows and sign out of **SEA-WS1**.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully configured disk encryption by using Intune.
