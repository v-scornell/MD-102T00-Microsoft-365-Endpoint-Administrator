# Practice Lab: Manage Device Enrollment into Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you prepare for device management using Microsoft Intune by reviewing and assigning licenses, configuring Windows automatic enrollment, and configuring enrollment restrictions. 

### Prerequisites

To following lab(s) must be completed before this lab:

- 0101-Managing Identities in Azure AD

- 0102-Synchronizing Identities by using Azure AD Connect

  > Note: You will also need a mobile phone that can receive text messages used to secure Windows Hello sign in authentication to Azure AD.

### Scenario

You need to prepare for device management using Microsoft Intune. First of all, you need to ensure that users are assigned appropriate licenses for device management. As a verification test, you will assign Aaron Nicholls the required licenses. You also need to ensure that any Windows device that is joined or registered to Azure AD will automatically be enrolled into Intune. You have also been asked to ensure that members of the Sales group are restricted from enrolling personal Android and iOS devices into Intune and that the Enrollment Device Limit is increased to 10 devices. Finally, you need to configure Allan Deyoung as a Device enrollment manager to allow him to enroll 1000 devices.

### Task 1: Review and assign licenses for device management

1. On **SEA-SVR1**, if necessary, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd** and close **Server Manager**.
