# Practice Lab: Managing Identities in Azure AD

## WWL Tenants - Terms of Use

If you are being provided with a tenant as a part of an instructor-led training delivery, please note that the tenant is made available for the purpose of supporting the hands-on labs in the instructor-led training. 

Tenants should not be shared or used for purposes outside of hands-on labs. The tenant used in this course is a trial tenant and cannot be used or accessed after the class is over and are not eligible for extension. 

Tenants must not be converted to a paid subscription. Tenants obtained as a part of this course remain the property of Microsoft Corporation and we reserve the right to obtain access and repossess at any time.

## Summary

In this lab, you will use the Azure Active Directory admin center to create and modify users, assign administrative roles, create and modify groups, and manage license assignments in Azure AD.

## Exercise 1: Creating users in Azure AD

### Scenario

You need to create user accounts in Azure AD for new employees that will start next week. New users are listed in the following table:

| Name           | User Name                             | Password | Job title        | Department |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Edmund Reeve   | `ereeve@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`   | Pa55w.rd | HR Rep           | HR         |
| Miranda Snider | `msnider@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`  | Pa55w.rd | Helpdesk Manager | Operations |
| Cody Godinez   | `cgodinez@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com` | Pa55w.rd | Sales Rep        | Sales      |

_Note: For location use either your local region or United States._

You've also been told that several more employees will be hired over the next couple of months. You've decided that scripting would be a far more efficient method of adding a large number of new users. You've decided to create a PowerShell script and test it out when you create Cody Godinez's account.

### Task 1: Create users by using the Azure Active Directory admin center

1. On **SEA-SVR1**, sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password of **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Close **Server Manager**.

3. On the taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.

4. In the address bar, enter **<http://portal.office.com>**.

5. At the Sign-in prompt, enter **`admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`** and then select **Next**.

6. At the Enter password page, enter the password for the Admin account and then select **Sign in**.

   > Note: Check with your instructor on the password to use for signing in with the Admin account.

7. At the Save password prompt, select **Save**.

8. At the Stay signed in prompt, select **No**. The Office 365 portal opens.

9. At the top left corner, select the **App launcher** and then select **Admin**. The Microsoft 365 admin center opens.

10. Select the **Navigation menu** and then select **Show all**.

11. In the Navigation pane, under **Admin centers** select **Azure Active Directory**. The Azure Active Directory admin center opens.

12. In the Azure Active Directory admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Users**.

    > Take note of the users that already exist as members of the Azure AD domain. Each user is enabled as indicated on the **Account enabled** column. The **Directory synced** column states **No** for all current users. This indicates that each user was created directly in Azure AD and not synchronized from an on-premises directory service.

13. On the **Users | All users** page, select **New user** then select **Create new user**.

14. On the **New User** page, ensure that **Create user** is selected, enter the following:

    - User Name: **`ereeve@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`**
    - Name: **Edmund Reeve**

15. Select **Let me create the password.**

16. Next to **Initial password**, enter **Pa55w.rd**.

17. Under **Groups and roles**, take note that this new user will not be a member of any group, and will be assigned the **User** role.

    > Note: The **User** role does not provide any administrative privileges

18. Under **Settings**, next to **Usage location**, select **United States**. If necessary, close the **Save password** prompt.

19. Under **Job info**, next to **Job title**, enter **HR Rep**.

20. Under **Job info**, next to **Department**, enter **HR** and then select **Create**.

    - User Name: **`msnider@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`**
    - Name: **Miranda Snider**

23. Select **Let me create the password.**

24. Next to **Initial password**, enter **Pa55w.rd**.

25. Under **Groups and roles**, take note that this new user will not be a member of any group, and will be assigned the **User** role.

    > Note: The **User** role does not provide any administrative privileges.

26. Under **Settings**, next to **Usage location**, select **United States**. If necessary, close the **Save password** prompt.

27. Under **Job info**, next to **Job title**, enter **Helpdesk Manager**.

28. Under **Job info**, next to **Department**, enter **Operations** and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Create users by using PowerShell

1. On **SEA-SVR1**, on the taskbar, right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

```

4. In the **Sign in to your account** dialog box, sign in as **`admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`** with the tenant password, and then select **Sign in**.

5. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following code to create a new user, and then press **Enter**. Be sure to replace "yourtenant" with your assigned tenant name:

```
New-MsolUser –UserPrincipalName cgodinez@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com -DisplayName “Cody Godinez” -FirstName “Cody” -LastName “Godinez” -Password ‘Pa55w.rd’ -ForceChangePassword $false -UsageLocation “US” -Title "Sales Rep" -Department "Sales"
```

6. In the **Windows PowerShell** window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Get-MsolUser
```

> Verify that the list of users from your tenant is displayed. Also take note of which users have a license assigned. Any user with the **isLicensed** value of **False** has not been assigned a license.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have successfully created new user accounts in Azure AD.
